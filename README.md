# OOP-inheritance-with-input-elements
A OOP inheritance example in Typescript with input elements. Validation output in the console

In this example different input element are created in Typescript. 
A general class 'InputField' stores all the generic logic. 

The class 'CheckBox' overrides the isEmpty logic. This is because a 'TextField' and a 'Checkbox' have different ways of
checking if the input element 'is empty'.
